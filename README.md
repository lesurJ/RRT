Rapidly-exploring Random Tree

In this repository, I propose a python implementation of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree.

For the development of this code I was inspired by
* the original paper by Steven M. Lavalle named *Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees: A New Tool for Path Planning.* Tech. rep. 1998.
